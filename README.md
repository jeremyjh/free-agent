This project is not yet useful; I had been developing it in a private repository but have decided to release it on Github even though it is still very much a work in progress.

This project has changed directions a couple of times already - the only real purpose it has served to date is to provide me with opportunities to learn Haskell and specific libraries/frameworks such as Lens, Distributed Process Platform and Acid State. I've also spun out from it one library that I developed early on, which I've released on [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/higher-leveldb) and [Github](https://github.com/jeremyjh/higher-leveldb) as 'higher-leveldb'. I still will use this in a separate, optional package for specific use cases though I'm now using Acid State as the primary database.

The goal presently: This project is intended to provide a library or framework for developing distributed peer-to-peer applications for systems automation, monitoring and management use cases.
