This project is not yet useful; I had been developing it in a private repository with
another provider but have decided to release it on Github even though it is still very much
a work in progress.

This project has changed directions a couple of times already - the only real
purpose it has served to date is to provide me with opportunities to learn Haskell
and specific libraries/frameworks such as Lens, ResourceT and Distributed Process. I've
also spun out from it one library that I developed early on, which I've already released on Hackage
and Github as 'higher-leveldb'. 

The purported goal presently: This project is intended to provide a library or framework for 
developing independent but collaborating agents primarily for use cases in 
distributed systems management.
